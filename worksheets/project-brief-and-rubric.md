# Project Brief + Rubric

## Project Brief
Create a short presentation or performance plan that connects:
- One instrument (from Explorer)
- One rhythm pattern (from Rhythm Patterns)
- One community story or tradition (family, neighborhood, or national event)
- One local Guyanese musician (artist, band, or tradition-bearer)

### Deliverables
- 3-5 slides OR a one-page poster
- 1 short paragraph describing the social meaning (lifestyle/behavior/identity)
- 1 cited source or quote about the local musician (interview, article, class research)
- 1 comparison across Guyana's diverse ethnic groups and the lesson learned
- 1 climate resilience link (how music responds to environmental change or supports community action)
- Optional: a 30-60 second rhythm demonstration

- Did I compare across Guyana's diverse ethnic groups and explain the lesson learned?
- Did I include a climate resilience link?
- Is my explanation clear and respectful?
