# Quick Lesson Plan: Regional Music Curriculum

## Overview
A short, classroom-ready sequence that introduces Guyanese musical traditions and connects them to social life, migration, and identity.

## Time
45-60 minutes

## Materials
- Ethnomusic Lab GY (Explorer + Rhythm Patterns tabs)
- Board or chart paper
- Student notebooks
- Sticky notes or index cards (for the Genre Timeline wall)

## Lesson Steps
1. **Warm-up (5 min):** Ask students to name a song that represents a community or event. List responses.
2. **Explore (10 min):** Use Instrument Explorer to find one instrument from each region. Students record name, material, and cultural role.
3. **Rhythm Lab (10 min):** Play two rhythm patterns and discuss how they could fit different celebrations.
4. **Sociology Lens (10 min):** Small groups answer one guiding question about lifestyle, behavior, or identity.
5. **Soundtrack of Daily Life (5 min):** Students list 3 sounds from home/community and what they reveal about routines or values.
6. **Genre Timeline Wall (5-10 min):** Place genre cards on a timeline with migration, trade, or political events.
7. **Comparative Reflection (5 min):** What lesson do we learn by comparing music across Guyana's diverse ethnic groups?
8. **Climate Resilience Link (5 min):** How do climate events affect music traditions, and how can music support resilience?
9. **Share (5 min):** Groups report back with one key insight.
10. **Exit Ticket (5 min):** Use the Exit Ticket worksheet.

## Differentiation
- Provide sentence starters for discussion.
- Allow oral responses instead of written notes.
- Pair advanced learners to lead rhythm demonstrations.

## Homework (Optional)
Interview a family member about a song used at home or community events.
