### Study Tips

- **Don't skip the cultural context** - It's tempting to jump to coding, but understanding the culture is essential
- **Practice active listening** - Don't just hear the music; engage with it deeply
- **Experiment with code** - Try variations beyond the examples
- **Ask questions** - In class, on forums, during office hours
- **Form study groups** - Collaborative learning enriches understanding
- **Reflect regularly** - Keep a learning journal
- **Balance technical and cultural** - Both are equally important

## For Instructors

### Implementation Guide
