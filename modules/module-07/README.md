## Lesson Plan: Reading the Sonic DNA

**Module Fit:** Module 7 – Remix, Reflection, and Exhibition  
**Optional Extension:** Module 3 – Computational Sound Analysis

**Grade Level:** Upper Secondary (Forms 4–6) / Year 1 Undergraduate  
**Duration:** 60 minutes

### Graph Focus
Mean Embedding Fingerprints (500-D OpenL3 Audio Embeddings)

### Resources Needed
- Projected or printed copy of "Mean Embedding Fingerprints" graph
- Highlighters or color pens (for annotation)
- Short audio clips from both Baboon Dance and Festival of the Sun
- Student Worksheet #8

### Learning Objectives
- Understand how machine learning models convert sound into data
- Interpret dimensional embeddings and what they reveal about sound features
- Compare spectral, rhythmic, and timbral complexity across cultures
- Reflect on the use of computational tools to explore cultural distinctiveness

### Lesson Flow

**Starter (10 min)**

*Prompt Discussion:*
Display the graph and ask students:
- What do you think this graph is showing?
- Why might we call this a "musical fingerprint"?
- What are the x-axis (dimension) and y-axis (value) likely representing?

*Mini Concept Review:*
- Embeddings = compressed vectors of high-level audio features
- Each dimension represents an abstract feature (pitch stability, texture, attack, etc.)
- Similar shapes suggest overlap; divergence indicates musical contrast

**Core Activity (35 min)**

*Part A: Visual Feature Analysis (15 min)*

In small groups, students:
- Highlight where Baboon Dance (red) and Festival of the Sun (blue) diverge most strongly
- Identify 3-4 regions of "distinctive spikes"
- Hypothesize what those differences might represent sonically (e.g., more vocal percussiveness, fewer tonal instruments)

*Part B: Listening Comparison (20 min)*
- Play short samples from both traditions
- Students annotate: Which parts of the sound could correspond to spikes in the graph?
  - Is Baboon Dance more percussive?
  - Does Festival of the Sun use more sustained harmonic tones?

**Wrap-Up / Reflection (15 min)**

*Class Discussion:*
- If each song has a fingerprint, what makes them musically "unique" in this data?
- Can data capture cultural nuance or only sonic structure?
- Should these "fingerprints" be used in cultural preservation, classification, or education?

*Exit Slip Prompt:*
"In your own words, explain what a 'mean embedding fingerprint' reveals about how music is interpreted by computers."
