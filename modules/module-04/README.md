# Module 4: Comparative Ethnomusicology

**Duration:** 2-3 weeks  
**Level:** Intermediate

## Module Overview

Building on computational analysis skills, this module focuses on comparing the Baboon Dance with other Indigenous musical traditions, particularly the Festival of the Sun (Inti Raymi) from Quechua culture in Peru. Students will use both qualitative and quantitative methods to understand musical difference, cultural distinctiveness, and potential areas of convergence.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- Conduct systematic comparative analysis of musical traditions
- Integrate computational and ethnographic methods
- Identify both sonic and cultural factors that distinguish traditions
- Interpret PCA plots and embedding visualizations in comparative context
- Articulate the value and limitations of cross-cultural music comparison
- Design culturally sensitive comparative research

## Key Concepts

### Comparative Ethnomusicology
- **Cross-cultural comparison:** Methods and ethics
- **Musical universals vs. particulars:** What's shared, what's unique
- **Emic vs. Etic perspectives:** Insider vs. outsider viewpoints
- **Cultural context in interpretation:** Why comparison requires cultural knowledge

### Analytical Frameworks
- **Sonic similarity:** Acoustic and structural features
- **Cultural function:** Ceremonial, social, spiritual roles
- **Historical connections:** Migration, trade, shared ancestry
- **Contemporary contexts:** Preservation, adaptation, revival

### Computational Comparison
- **Feature-based comparison:** Tempo, pitch, timbre analysis
- **Embedding-based similarity:** Neural network representations
- **Clustering analysis:** Grouping similar segments
- **Visualization techniques:** PCA, dendrograms, heatmaps

## Key Activities

- Statistical comparison of feature distributions
- Identify distinguishing characteristics

**Activity 4.4: PCA Clustering Analysis**
- Generate combined PCA plot (from Module 3)
- Analyze cluster separation and overlap
- Identify outliers and boundary cases
- Interpret what principal components capture

**Activity 4.5: Embedding Fingerprint Comparison**
- Compare mean embedding fingerprints
- Identify dimensions with greatest difference
- Relate differences to sonic qualities
- Create annotated visualization

### Week 3: Integration and Interpretation

**Activity 4.6: Why Are They Different?**
- Synthesize computational and cultural findings
- Hypothesize about sonic differences:
  - Instrumentation (drums vs. flutes)
  - Vocal techniques (intensity, style)
  - Rhythmic complexity
  - Harmonic content
- Connect to cultural purposes and environments

**Activity 4.7: Comparative Presentation**
- Groups present on one aspect of comparison
- Include both computational data and cultural interpretation
- Address: What makes each tradition distinctive?
- Discuss: Value of comparative analysis

## Required Materials

### Audio Datasets
- Baboon Dance recordings (multiple performances)
- Festival of the Sun (Inti Raymi) recordings
- Both available in [Audio Library](../../resources/audio/)

### Worksheets
- [Worksheet #6: Comparative Listening Guide](../../worksheets/worksheet-06.md)
- [Worksheet #7: PCA Interpretation](../../worksheets/worksheet-07.md)

### Readings
- Articles on comparative ethnomusicology methods
- Cultural background texts on both traditions
- Ethical guidelines for cross-cultural research

## Lesson Plan: PCA of Ritual Soundscapes

**Duration:** 60 minutes

### Learning Objectives
- Analyze and interpret PCA plots as visualizations of musical difference
- Understand what principal components reveal about sound structure
- Reflect on cultural meaning embedded in different ritual traditions
- Critically examine how computation models musical identity

### Materials Needed
- PCA plot (projected or printed)
- Short audio clips from both traditions
- Student Worksheet #7
- Projector and headphones for listening

### Lesson Flow

**Starter (10 min)**
Display the PCA plot and ask:
- What do you notice about the clustering?
- Do the two traditions overlap in any way?
- What might the axes PC1 and PC2 represent in terms of sound?

**Concepts Introduced:**
- PCA = dimensionality reduction technique
- Clustering = similarity in feature space
- Each dot = a windowed segment of audio embedded by OpenL3

**Core Activity (35 min)**

*Part A: Graph Interpretation (15 min)*
- Where do Baboon Dance samples cluster? What about Festival of the Sun?
- Are there any overlaps or outliers?
- What might a tight cluster suggest about rhythmic or melodic consistency?

*Part B: Comparative Listening (20 min)*
Play 15-20 second excerpts:
- **Baboon Dance** – focus on rhythm and vocal intensity
- **Festival of the Sun** – focus on instrumental texture and melodic phrasing

Students note:
- Instrumentation, repetition, density, pacing
- Hypothesize why they are distinct clusters in PCA

**Prompt Questions:**
- What does the PCA visualization teach us that sound alone might not?
- Can computation capture cultural context, or just sonic similarity?
- Why is it valuable to compare Indigenous musics across regions?

**Optional Extension:**
Students propose a remix, artistic reimagining, or exhibition combining visual and sonic data to show musical divergence or convergence.

**Wrap-up (15 min)**
- Share observations and hypotheses
- Discuss how computational and cultural perspectives complement each other
- Preview next steps in analysis

## Additional Resources

- Interactive embedding visualizations
- Map showing geographic and cultural contexts

### Methodological Resources

## Instructor Notes

### Facilitation Tips
- Emphasize respect and avoid hierarchy ("better/worse")
- Encourage students to identify bias in their own listening
- Invite multiple interpretations of computational results
- Connect abstract visualizations to tangible musical experiences

### Sensitive Topics
- **Cultural appropriation:** Discuss boundaries of comparison
- **Colonial legacies:** Address historical power dynamics
- **Representation:** Who has the authority to compare?
- **Generalization:** Avoid treating either tradition as monolithic

### Assessment Guidance
- Value integration of methods over technical perfection
- Reward cultural sensitivity and ethical awareness
- Look for evidence-based reasoning, not "right" answers
- Encourage creative presentation formats

## Connection to Next Module

Module 5 will focus on creating effective visualizations that communicate complex computational findings while honoring cultural context. Students will learn design principles for presenting comparative data ethically and engagingly.
