# Ethics Guide for Digital Humanities Research

## Introduction

This guide provides ethical frameworks for conducting digital humanities research with cultural materials, particularly Indigenous and minoritized traditions like the Baboon Dance. Ethical practice is not optional—it is fundamental to respectful scholarship.

## Core Ethical Principles

### 1. Do No Harm

**Principle:** Research should not cause damage to communities, individuals, or cultural traditions.

**In Practice:**
- Assess potential risks before beginning work
- Consider how materials might be misused or misinterpreted
- Protect privacy and confidentiality
- Avoid exposing sacred or sensitive content
- Be prepared to stop or modify work if harm is identified

**Questions to Ask:**
- Who might be harmed by this research?
- What are the worst-case scenarios for misuse?
- Have I consulted with affected communities about risks?
- Do benefits outweigh potential harms?

### 2. Informed Consent

**Principle:** People have the right to understand and agree to how their cultural materials will be used.

**In Practice:**
- Explain research purpose, methods, and intended uses in clear language
- Ensure consent is voluntary, not coerced
- Allow people to ask questions and negotiate terms
- Obtain written documentation of consent
- Respect the right to withdraw consent
- Return to communities for additional consent if uses change

**Questions to Ask:**
- Do knowledge holders fully understand what I'm asking?
- Have I explained technical aspects in accessible ways?
- Is there any pressure or power imbalance affecting consent?
- What happens if someone wants to withdraw consent later?

### 3. Community Benefit

**Principle:** Research should provide value to the communities being studied, not just to researchers.

**In Practice:**
- Ask communities what would benefit them
- Share findings in accessible formats
- Provide copies of documentation to communities
- Support cultural preservation and education efforts
- Acknowledge community expertise and contributions
- Consider revenue sharing if work is commercialized

**Questions to Ask:**
- How does this research serve the community?
- What do community members want from this collaboration?
- Am I extracting knowledge without reciprocity?
- How can I ensure long-term benefits, not just short-term?

### 4. Cultural Respect

**Principle:** Cultural traditions deserve respect, dignity, and appropriate representation.

**In Practice:**
- Learn about cultural protocols and follow them
- Avoid stereotypes, exoticization, or romanticization
- Represent complexity and diversity within communities
- Use appropriate terminology chosen by communities
- Acknowledge sacred or restricted knowledge
- Present as living, evolving traditions, not museum artifacts

**Questions to Ask:**
- How do community members want to be represented?
- What stereotypes am I unconsciously reinforcing?
- Am I treating this culture with the same respect as my own?
- Have I checked my assumptions and biases?

### 5. Intellectual Property and Attribution

**Principle:** Communities have rights over their cultural knowledge and should be properly credited.

**In Practice:**
- Cite knowledge holders and communities, not just academic sources
- Use Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels when appropriate
- Respect cultural ownership of songs, stories, and practices
- Negotiate terms for use and attribution
- Don't claim "discovery" of knowledge communities have held for generations
- Follow community preferences for attribution

**Questions to Ask:**
- Who owns this knowledge?
- How should attribution be formatted?
- Are there cultural protocols around sharing this knowledge?
- What rights does the community retain?

## Specific Ethical Considerations for Digital Work

### Digital Preservation and Access

**Balance:** Preservation is valuable, but unlimited access can be problematic.

**Considerations:**
- Not all materials should be openly accessible
- Sacred or sensitive content may need restrictions
- Privacy concerns in digital age
- Permanence of digital materials (hard to "take back")
- Risk of decontextualization and misuse

**Best Practices:**
- Implement tiered access (community, researchers, public)
- Use TK Labels to communicate cultural protocols
- Include cultural context with all materials
- Plan for long-term community control
- Design systems that can remove or restrict materials

### Computational Analysis

**Balance:** Algorithms can reveal patterns, but may miss cultural meaning.

**Considerations:**
- What does computational analysis reduce or erase?
- How might algorithms perpetuate biases?
- Can quantification capture qualitative cultural significance?
- Who benefits from making culture "machine-readable"?
- Risk of dehumanizing cultural expression

**Best Practices:**
- Always pair computational analysis with cultural interpretation
- Acknowledge limitations of technical methods
- Consult with communities about analytical approaches
- Don't present computational findings as objective truth
- Maintain human meaning-making alongside machine analysis

### Social Media and Online Sharing

**Balance:** Sharing can educate and celebrate, but also exploit.

**Considerations:**
- Viral content can be taken out of context
- Comments sections can be harmful
- Once shared, control is limited
- Commercial platforms profit from cultural content
- Global audience may not understand cultural nuances

**Best Practices:**
- Get explicit consent for online sharing
- Provide robust cultural context
- Monitor and moderate comments if possible
- Consider platform choice carefully
- Be prepared to remove content if requested

## Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels

### What Are TK Labels?

Developed by Local Contexts (localcontexts.org), TK Labels help Indigenous communities:
- Communicate cultural protocols
- Identify appropriate uses of materials
- Assert rights and interests in cultural heritage
- Educate users about cultural context

### Common TK Labels

**TK Attribution (TK A)**
- Correct attribution required
- Community wants to be credited

**TK Non-Commercial (TK NC)**
- Not for commercial use
- Community must benefit from any commercial use

**TK Community Voice (TK CV)**
- Community should be consulted
- Community has ongoing relationship to materials

**TK Seasonal (TK S)**
- Access or use only during certain times
- Respects seasonal cultural protocols

**TK Secret/Sacred (TK SS)**
- Restricted materials
- Access only for authorized community members

**TK Community Use Only (TK CU)**
- Only for community use
- Outsiders should not access

### Implementing TK Labels

1. **Learn about labels:** Visit localcontexts.org
2. **Consult with communities:** Which labels apply?
3. **Apply labels to materials:** In metadata and display
4. **Educate users:** Explain what labels mean
5. **Enforce protocols:** Design systems to respect restrictions

## CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance

### Collective Benefit
- Data ecosystems should benefit Indigenous communities
- Enable Indigenous innovation and self-determination
- Support participation in governance

### Authority to Control
- Indigenous rights in data must be recognized
- Indigenous governance aligns with Indigenous values
- Right to develop cultural protocols

### Responsibility
- Sharing responsibilities for data use
- Transparency and accountability
- Support capacity building in communities

### Ethics

## Case Study: Ethical Dilemmas

### Dilemma 1: Sacred Content in Public Archive

**Scenario:** You've recorded a ceremony that includes both public and sacred elements. You want to archive it for preservation.

**Ethical Questions:**
- Should the entire recording be restricted?
- Can you edit out sacred portions?
- Who decides what's sacred vs. public?
- What if community members disagree?

**Possible Approach:**
- Consult with community authorities
- Consider creating multiple versions (full vs. excerpted)
- Implement appropriate access restrictions
- Document what portions are restricted and why
- Plan for community control over future access

### Dilemma 2: Commercial Interest in Research

**Scenario:** A streaming service wants to license music from your research for a documentary.

**Ethical Questions:**
- Who has the right to authorize this?
- How should revenue be shared?
- Will the music be presented respectfully?
- What control does the community have over final product?

**Possible Approach:**
- Facilitate direct negotiation between company and community
- Ensure community legal counsel is available
- Advocate for meaningful compensation and creative control
- Review final product with community before release
- Support community in protecting their interests

### Dilemma 3: Contested Traditions

**Scenario:** Different groups claim authority over the same tradition with different perspectives on how it should be represented.

**Ethical Questions:**
- Who speaks for the tradition?
- How do you represent multiple perspectives?
- What if groups are in conflict?
- Should you get involved at all?

**Possible Approach:**
- Acknowledge multiple perspectives explicitly
- Don't take sides or declare one view "correct"
- Represent complexity and disagreement honestly
- Consider whether your involvement helps or harms
- May need to step back if your presence escalates conflict

## Ethical Review and Oversight

### Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)

Most institutions require ethical review for research with human subjects.

**What They Cover:**
- Risk assessment
- Informed consent procedures
- Privacy and confidentiality
- Vulnerable populations

**Limitations:**
- May not adequately address cultural concerns
- Indigenous research ethics often go beyond IRB requirements
- Community protocols may be more stringent than IRB

**Best Practice:** Comply with IRB *and* additional community ethical frameworks.

### Community Review

**Why It Matters:**
- Communities know their own ethical standards best
- Builds trust and accountability
- Identifies issues researchers might miss
- Empowers community oversight

**How to Implement:**
- Establish community advisory board
- Share drafts for review and comment
- Incorporate feedback meaningfully
- Give communities veto power over objectionable content
- Maintain ongoing dialogue, not just one-time consultation

## Ethical Reflection Questions

Before starting any work with cultural materials, ask yourself:

1. **Relationships:**
   - What is my relationship to this community?
   - Have I invested in building trust?
   - Am I an outsider extracting knowledge?

2. **Power:**
   - What power do I hold in this research relationship?
   - How can I share power with community members?
   - Who controls the research process and products?

3. **Benefit:**
   - Who benefits from this research?
   - Does the community want this research done?
   - How am I giving back?

4. **Respect:**
   - Am I honoring cultural protocols?
   - Have I checked my biases and assumptions?
   - Would community members approve of how I'm working?

5. **Legacy:**
   - What are the long-term impacts of this work?
   - Will this research still be ethical in 10, 50, 100 years?
   - What legacy am I leaving for future community generations?
