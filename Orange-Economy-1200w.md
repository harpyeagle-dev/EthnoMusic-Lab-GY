The (Rotten) Orange Economy: A Critical Assessment of Guyana's Creative Development Framework

Recent discourse on the Orange Economy in Guyana promises a transformative approach positioning creativity, culture, and innovation at the center of economic growth. Yet critical examination reveals a fundamental gap between rhetorical endorsement and institutional reality. The Orange Economy is not rotten in concept but in default—the architects have failed to establish foundational prerequisites: intellectual property frameworks, genuine cultural heritage preservation, Indigenous cultural sovereignty protections, and adequate educational infrastructure. Without these foundations, the Orange Economy risks becoming another extractive enterprise that generates value for outsiders while leaving creators, communities, and tradition bearers dispossessed.

The Missing Foundation: Intellectual Property

The Orange Economy rests on eight pillars: intellectual property, creative industries, cultural heritage, digital technology, education, cultural tourism, creative hubs, and governance. Yet Guyanese discourse has conspicuously ignored the most foundational pillar—intellectual property protection. IP frameworks protect creative works and ensure creators benefit from their contributions. They encompass copyright, trademarks, patents, licensing, and dispute resolution. Strong IP protection incentivizes creative investment, attracts talent and capital, enables monetization, and establishes legal certainty for commercial transactions.

No substantive discussion of IP frameworks has occurred in official Orange Economy proposals. This is not a minor oversight—it is a fundamental failure. Creators must ask: Who owns the works I create? Without functional IP frameworks, creators lack incentive to professionalize. International investors face legal uncertainty. Cultural products become vulnerable to unauthorized use. Guyana's creative sector cannot compete regionally or globally. The Orange Economy becomes extraction rather than development.

Cultural Heritage: Preservation or Erasure?

Guyana possesses extraordinary cultural heritage—museums, historical sites, and intangible cultural practices. Yet the nation engages in systematic erasure. Historic buildings are demolished or mutilated, replaced with concrete structures that erase historical context. This contradicts any serious claim to Orange Economy implementation. How will these sites be restored and reactivated as cultural and economic assets? The architects provide no answer.

The contradiction deepens with Indigenous cultural heritage. Indigenous concepts differ profoundly from Western models. Indigenous knowledge systems embed culture in sociocosmic philosophies where the environment and all species are inseparable from human identity. Cultural heritage belongs to the collective. Sacred knowledge has restricted circulation. Certain practices should not be commercialized. Yet Guyana's government simultaneously pursues aggressive resource extraction—mining, logging, oil development—that directly threatens Indigenous territories and cultural continuity. How can the state preserve Indigenous heritage while pursuing resource extraction that destroys it?

The Kaieteur Falls case exemplifies this failure. The Patamuna Nation maintains an artifact—a memorial to Chief Old Kaie—near the Falls. This object embodies historical memory, educational value, and tourism potential. When the Ministry of Public Works announced airstrip expansion, advocates requested preservation. The artifact has since disappeared, likely destroyed, with no public accountability. An object that could have anchored cultural and economic value has been erased. This encapsulates the Orange Economy's central problem: rhetorical commitment coupled with institutional indifference.

Indigenous Music and Digital Sovereignty

Historically, Western scholarship approached Indigenous music through extractive research—positioning Indigenous people as passive subjects, treating knowledge as freely available for appropriation, generating external value, and excluding Indigenous people from economic benefit. Digital technology creates both opportunity and peril. Communities can now document and circulate traditions on their own terms. Yet digitalization enables unauthorized appropriation, commercial exploitation without community benefit, and decontextualized circulation reinforcing stereotypes.

The central question: How can Indigenous musical traditions be documented, circulated, and commercialized without diluting cultural specificity and enabling extraction? Solutions require moving beyond traditional copyright. They include community-controlled distribution platforms, Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels communicating cultural protocols, benefit-sharing agreements ensuring community control, educational frameworks teaching cultural respect, and legal protections against appropriation.

The Baboon Dance exemplifies this challenge. As a Guyanese tradition, it could anchor cultural preservation and creative economy development. Effective integration requires community consultation on representation and commercialization, educational resources explaining cultural significance, revenue-sharing models benefiting tradition bearers, community-controlled digital archiving, and respectful international presentation. Without these elements, the Baboon Dance becomes another cultural commodity extracted from its community.

Education as Foundation

The Orange Economy thrives only with robust education and skills development—formal programs from primary through postgraduate, vocational training in digital design and music production, apprenticeships, and industry partnerships. Yet Guyana's institutions lack contemporary curricula, integration of Indigenous artistic knowledge, vocational pathways in creative fields, mentorship infrastructure, and adequate funding. Without educational investment, the Orange Economy cannot develop the talent pipeline necessary for sustained growth.

Meaningful implementation requires curriculum reform at all levels, faculty development in contemporary practices, genuine industry partnerships, scholarship programs democratizing access, and digital infrastructure supporting online learning. These investments demand sustained government commitment and resources. Ambitious rhetoric without educational infrastructure remains hollow.

Toward Institutional Reality

Moving from rhetoric to reality requires five critical conditions. First, develop comprehensive intellectual property legislation protecting copyright, trademarks, patents, and dispute resolution. Second, establish Indigenous cultural protocols—community-controlled frameworks for documentation, benefit-sharing, and representation approval. Third, move cultural heritage preservation from rhetoric to resource allocation, site restoration, and employment creation. Fourth, reform educational curricula and fund mentorship infrastructure. Fifth, coordinate policy across cultural, economic, and educational sectors with transparent resource allocation and regular assessment.

These are not optional refinements. They are foundational requirements for any credible Orange Economy. Without them, Guyana will continue extracting cultural value while allowing that value to flow elsewhere. Creators will remain undercapitalized. Communities will watch their heritage erased or commercialized without benefit. Indigenous traditions will be appropriated and misrepresented. Creative talent will lack educational pathways.

Conclusion

The Orange Economy represents transformative potential for Guyana. The nation possesses extraordinary cultural diversity, artistic traditions, creative talent, and geographic opportunity. However, the gap between rhetorical endorsement and institutional capacity remains vast. The architects must address foundational questions: Who owns creative works? How will heritage be preserved rather than exploited? How will Indigenous sovereignty be respected? Will educational institutions develop creative talent? What governance structures will coordinate transformation?

The Orange Economy is not rotten in concept. It is rotten by default—absent structures ensuring creators benefit from their work, communities control their heritage, Indigenous sovereignty is respected, and necessary talent develops. Guyana has the assets and opportunity to lead the Caribbean in cultural-economic development. Whether it possesses political will to build necessary institutional, legal, and educational frameworks remains the decisive question.
