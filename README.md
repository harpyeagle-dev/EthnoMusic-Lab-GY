# Decoding the Baboon Dance: A Curriculum in Digital Humanities and Computational Ethnomusicology

**Author:** Rohan Sagar  
**Date:** June 15, 2025

## Overview

This digital curriculum explores the intersection of ethnomusicology, digital humanities, and computational analysis through the lens of the Baboon Dance—a traditional cultural practice from Guyana. Students will learn to combine cultural understanding with cutting-edge computational tools to analyze, preserve, and reimagine Indigenous musical traditions.

## Curriculum Goals

- Develop critical understanding of ethnomusicology and Indigenous music traditions
- Learn computational methods for sound analysis and pattern recognition
- Apply machine learning techniques to cultural heritage preservation
- Create digital exhibits and presentations that honor cultural authenticity
- Foster interdisciplinary thinking across humanities, technology, and arts

## Target Audience

- **Grade Level:** Upper Secondary (Forms 4–6) / Year 1 Undergraduate
- **Prerequisites:** Basic music appreciation, introductory computer skills
- **Duration:** Full semester (14-16 weeks)

## Module Structure

### [Module 1: Foundations of Ethnomusicology and the Baboon Dance](modules/module-01/README.md)
Introduction to ethnomusicology, cultural context of the Baboon Dance, and ethical considerations in studying Indigenous music.

### [Module 2: Computational Sound Analysis](modules/module-02/README.md)
Learn audio signal processing, spectral analysis, and digital tools for sound visualization.

### [Module 3: Machine Learning for Audio](modules/module-03/README.md)
Explore embeddings, feature extraction, and pattern recognition in musical data.

### [Module 4: Comparative Ethnomusicology](modules/module-04/README.md)
Compare the Baboon Dance with other Indigenous traditions using computational methods.

### [Module 5: Data Visualization and Interpretation](modules/module-05/README.md)
Create meaningful visualizations that respect cultural context while revealing musical patterns.

### [Module 6: Digital Archiving and Preservation](modules/module-06/README.md)
Learn best practices for digitizing, cataloging, and preserving cultural heritage.

### [Module 7: Remix, Reflection, and Exhibition](modules/module-07/README.md)
Design and present a final digital exhibition combining analysis, creativity, and cultural sensitivity.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this curriculum, students will be able to:

1. Explain the cultural significance and historical context of the Baboon Dance
2. Use Python and audio libraries to analyze sound files
3. Apply machine learning models (OpenL3, PCA) to musical data
4. Interpret computational visualizations in cultural context
5. Create ethical, culturally-informed digital exhibits
6. Engage critically with technology's role in cultural preservation

## Assessment Approaches
